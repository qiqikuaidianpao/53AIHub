### Quick Installation

The recommended way to install 53AI Hub Community Edition is to run the one-line installer:

```

After the script finishes, follow the prompts to complete the setup and then visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to access the administration panel and begin setup.

### Alternative: Docker Installation

If you prefer Docker, you can still install from our `docker/docker-compose.yaml` file. Before running the installation command, ensure that https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ are installed on your machine.
